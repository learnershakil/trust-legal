      question: "How long will my litigation case take to resolve?",
      answer: "The timeline for litigation varies significantly depending on case complexity, court schedules, and whether settlement is possible. Simple matters might resolve in 6-9 months, while complex cases can take 1-3 years. Alternative dispute resolution methods like mediation can expedite resolution. During your consultation, we'll provide a realistic timeline estimate based on your specific circumstances."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the potential costs involved in litigation?",
      answer: "Litigation costs include legal fees, court filing fees, expert witness fees, document production expenses, and potentially costs awarded to the other party if unsuccessful. We offer various fee arrangements including hourly rates, flat fees for certain services, and in some cases, contingency arrangements. We provide transparent cost estimates upfront and regular updates as your case progresses to avoid surprises."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it better to settle or go to trial?",
      answer: "The decision to settle or proceed to trial depends on numerous factors including the strength of your case, potential damages, financial and emotional costs of prolonged litigation, risk tolerance, and confidentiality concerns. Settlements offer certainty, confidentiality, and cost control, while trials may be necessary when parties are far apart or important principles are at stake. We help you weigh these factors to make an informed decision aligned with your goals."
    },
    {
      question: "What documents should I preserve if I anticipate litigation?",
      answer: "It's crucial to preserve all potentially relevant documents including contracts, correspondence (emails, letters, texts), financial records, photographs, reports, meeting notes, and electronic data. Once litigation is reasonably anticipated, you have a legal duty to preserve evidence. We can help you implement a litigation hold, identify critical documents, and develop a document management strategy to ensure compliance with disclosure obligations while protecting privileged information."

                    <p className="text-[#1e2b3e]/70">
                      The supplier was demanding substantial damages for alleged breach of a long-term supply agreement. Our client maintained that poor quality and late deliveries justified their actions. With over $1.5 million at stake and potential damage to industry relationships, a strategic approach was essential.

                    <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-[#1e2b3e] mb-2">Our Approach</h3>
                    <p className="text-[#1e2b3e]/70">
                      We conducted a comprehensive review of all contract documents and performance records, identified key leverage points, and developed a strong counterclaim. Rather than proceeding directly to litigation, we proposed a structured mediation with clearly defined parameters, giving both sides a face-saving path to resolution.

                    <p className="text-[#1e2b3e]/70">
                      Through strategic negotiation and mediation, we secured a settlement at less than 30% of the original demand, with favorable payment terms and a restructured supply arrangement. The matter was resolved in four months, saving significant litigation costs and preserving important industry relationships.
