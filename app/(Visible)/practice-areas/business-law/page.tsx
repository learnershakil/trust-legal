  const businessFAQs = [
    {
      question: "When should I incorporate my business?",
      answer: "The optimal timing for incorporation depends on various factors including liability concerns, tax implications, funding needs, and growth plans. Generally, incorporation becomes beneficial when your business faces increased liability risks, requires external investment, or would benefit from tax advantages available to corporations. During your consultation, we can evaluate your specific situation to determine if incorporation is right for your business."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between a corporation and other business structures?",
      answer: "A corporation is a separate legal entity distinct from its owners, providing liability protection by separating personal assets from business liabilities. Other structures like sole proprietorships offer simplicity but no liability protection, while partnerships distribute liability among partners. Corporations also offer potential tax advantages, perpetual existence, and greater ease in raising capital, though they involve more regulatory compliance and administrative requirements."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I protect my business from contract disputes?",
      answer: "Preventing contract disputes begins with clearly written agreements that explicitly outline all terms, obligations, and remedies. Having your contracts professionally drafted or reviewed by a business attorney is crucial. Additional protective measures include documenting all communications, maintaining thorough records, establishing clear internal processes for contract management, building dispute resolution mechanisms into agreements, and conducting regular contract audits."
    },
    {
      question: "What should I consider before acquiring another business?",
      answer: "Before proceeding with an acquisition, conduct thorough due diligence covering financial health, legal compliance, intellectual property assets, existing contracts, employment matters, and potential liabilities. Consider the strategic fit, integration challenges, customer and supplier relationships, and market position. Develop a clear integration plan, understand regulatory approvals needed, and structure the deal appropriately. Our M&A team can guide you through this complex process."
